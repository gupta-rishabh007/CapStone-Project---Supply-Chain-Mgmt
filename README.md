# CapStone-Project---Supply-Chain-Mgmt
The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will  determine an optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse. 

An FMCG company entered the instant noodles market two years ago. Management has identified a mismatch between demand and supplyâ€”warehouses in high-demand areas face shortages, while those in low-demand areas are overstocked. Both scenarios lead to significant inventory cost losses. To address this, management aims to optimize supply quantities across all warehouses nationwide.

**Goal & Objective:** 

The task is to build a model using historical data to determine the optimal shipment size for each warehouse. Additionally, analyzing demand patterns across different regions will help management target advertising campaigns more effectively.

As this is the first phase of the engagement, the company has shared only limited data. If the initial results show tangible impact, they will provide full access to their complete data lake for developing a more robust model.
